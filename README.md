# Java-Manual
Define a class MyNumber having one private int data member. Write a default constructor to 
initialize it to 0 and another constructor to initialize it to a value (Use this). Write methods 
isNegative, isPositive, isZero, isOdd, isEven. Create an object in main. Use command line 
arguments to pass a value to the object (Hint : convert string argument to integer) and perform the 
above tests. Provide javadoc comments for all constructors and methods and generate the html 
help file.


//Array Of Objects
Java Eg 2
Define a Student class (roll number, name, percentage). Define a default and parameterized 
constructor. Keep a count of objects created. Create objects using parameterized constructor and 
display the object count after each object is created. (Use static member and method). Also 
display the contents of each object.
